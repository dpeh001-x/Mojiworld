## 🎯 Controls

Skills are laid out as a left-hand cluster (`Z X S C D F V G`) so you can reach every attack without leaving WASD-adjacent position. Press `?` in-game for a live keybind panel that shows your current class's skill names + cooldowns, or `I` for a short skill reference card.

### Movement

| Action | Key |
|---|---|
| Move left / right | `←` `→` |
| Jump (double / triple) | `Space` |
| Drop through platform | `↓` + `Space` |
| Enter portal | `↑` |
| Dodge roll | `Shift` |
| Block / Parry | `A` |
| Quick dash | double-tap `←` or `→` |

### Combat

| Action | Key |
|---|---|
| Basic attack | `Z` |
| Skill 2 | `X` |
| Skill 3 | `S` |
| Skill 4 | `C` |
| Skill 5 | `D` |
| Job signature (Lv 10) | `F` |
| Job ultimate (Lv 10) | `V` |
| Master signature (Lv 20) | `G` |

### UI & utility

| Action | Key |
|---|---|
| Talk to NPC (when one is in range) | `N` |
| Codex / achievements (when no NPC is in range) | `N` |
| Open chest / pick up drop | `F` |
| Inventory | `B` |
| Level-up panel | `K` or `U` |
| Skill reference | `I` |
| Help panel | `?` |
| Mute / unmute | `M` |
| HP / MP potion (3 s CD, buys with Lumen if none) | `R` / `T` (or `PgUp` / `PgDn`) |
| Reset save (confirms) | `9` |
| Re-pick job / master | `0` |
| Dev console | hold `1` + `2` + `3` |

> `N` is context-aware: next to an NPC it opens their dialog, otherwise it opens the Codex. `F` is reserved for chest / pickup / job signature skill — pressing `F` next to an NPC still talks as a legacy fallback, but `N` is the primary talk key.

## ⚔️ Classes
